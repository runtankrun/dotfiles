## Themes

Themes can be changed from `conky/configs/Theme.lua` file. I have tried to
modularize the configs for easy modifications as much as possible, but I have
only a week of experience in lua, so contributions for code improvements are
welcomed. Also new themes are welcomed :)

> I have developed these themes initially for a screen resolution of 1366x768
but actively looking into solutions for scaling them on different resolutions.

Available themes:

- Tron
- Westworld
