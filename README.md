<h3>Arch Linux: Complete Autonomy Over Your System</h3>
Arch Linux is a blank canvas. It only installs what you tell it to. <br>
- Want a Desktop? Install it. Terminal? Install it. Statusbar, dock, window manager, essentially anything a normal OS comes with, Arch will only install if you explicitly make it. Arch Linux is whatever you want it to be. Get Complete autonomy over your system.<br>
<h4>Set-Up</h4>
"That soundsd like a lot of work"<br>
It is and it isn't. Once a system is configured, sharing or transfering that system is as easy as cloning this repository into your home directory. Run Linux's easy package installer and you're done. Easily back-up or share your enviornment. Millions of configurations are already out there. Pick and choice.
<h4>Lightweight</h4>
-Since Arch only runs what you hand pick, the OS is incredibly lightweight<br>
-I rarely go over 3.5gb of RAM, even when simultaneously running multiple browser tabs, development software, e-books, spotify, video, etc. <br>
<h4>Package Manager</h4>
-Linux's Package Manger allows you to install/remove pretty much anything, by simply typing the name of the dependency into a terminal window
